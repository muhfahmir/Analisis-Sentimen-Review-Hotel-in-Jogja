"Had an amazing spa experience assisted by Mbak Hilda! In this pandemic era, my concern on going to spa places was the crowd, but in Gaharu they limit the customer (up to 2 person at a time) but I was lucky to be the only one that night. Mbak Hilda paid attention to every little detail, and make sure I was comfortable. The place itself was really great, I had all the treatments in just one room (except creambath). Will definitely recommend this experience to othersss <U+2728>","Positive","Nabila",5,"Traveled with family","December 2020"

The staff at the 8th floor lounge, Tika and Wahyu, were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Thumbs up. Breakfast selections are abundance especially the local cuisine, Gudeg, is delicious. Swimming pool is always clear especially during the pandemic - one has to make sure all the safety measurements are taken.  Gym facilities are top notch. The Sauna and the cold pool are perfect match for that Scandinavian style sauna.  So far all boxes are ticked with flying colours! I am hoping to return again to Hotel Tentrem in the bear future.","Positive","Josua Simanjuntak",5,"Traveled with family","November 2020"

"We visited Hotel Tentrem in Oct 2020 while the world was still afraid of COVID-19. I have to admit, the hotel took all possible precautions to keep its guest and staff safe. One example being, disinfecting the room with a spray several times a day even while the guests were in the room. They also had temp checks, hand sanitisers etc and a limited amount of guest were allowed to dine at one given time. What we loved most was its proximity to the bustling city and also the convenience of having smaller hotels and food stalls on the roadside which helped us accommodate the needs of our driver & maid. The staff were beyond amazing. Very friendly, hospitable and chatty, if you're up for a chat.

I've travelled around the world and explored numerous hotels before, but this hotel actually serves the best and the most polite service.

When we checked-in, we were told that only smoking rooms available despite we clearly requested for non smoking room when we booked the room two months prior. The reception asked us to upgrade the room to Suite with additional 3.5million rupiah per night in which we rejected. The horror continued. After entering the room, on that night the bathroom bulb was exploded and it caused burning small both in the bedroom as well as the entire hallway. Lastly, during our stay we were experienced several power outage in the afternoon. This is definitely the worst 5 Star hotel we have ever experienced.

"One of the best stays in Indoensia thus far. I stayed at Tentrem for two nights while visiting the local univesities. The room was spacious, and very well-maintained. All the staff were excellent. An example of exemplay service: as I walked in on the second day for breakfast, the staff asked me if I would like my cappuchino. Not sure if they remembered from the day before, or they just asked.

"Me and my husband stayed at Executive Suite for 2 nights. We must say that it was such a luxurious stay. The room was spacious, clean, and has an array of amenities. What impressed me was the hospitality of the staff, and the service they provide. They never missed a single request from us even just a small request. Not every hotel can do so, even a 5 star hotel.  The executive lounge was nice with all drinks and snacks. They have cocktail time from 5-7 pm. Just a suggestion, maybe the time can be adjusted to 4 pm, since 5 pm was a little bit close to dinner time. Breakfast was excellent, from the taste to the variety of food. They even have a stall for local coffee. Too bad I can't eat much for breakfast. They have plaground for kids which was quite big.

Here is the only problem I have with this hotel, at first I was drawn by how nice the staffs are; they were very communicative when I asked about best foods to get around etc. But then, the 20 minutes waiting time turned into 1 hour waiting time.

"I booked deluxe room directly through the hotel, asked the non smoking-pool view room and got exactly as my preference. I was impressed with the hospitality, service (its detail), and its ambience. Room's spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Free minibar with most product of Sido Muncul. Room service came twice in a day (they offer to clean the room in the evening as well). Breakfast was impressive with mix array of western and local cuisine and taste great. The pool was very nice (very inviting, big and suit for serious swimming), not too cold just perfect warmth. I don't try the gym facility though.   Well, there is a low down: can't access the wifi in the middle of the stay. The IT person came, try to find the problem.

"This may be the best hotel in town. It’s quite nice but in a standard way. The rooms were very nice but in an expected way. Food was good but not great. The service was a bit spotty. The desk staff was very helpful and polite but we had trouble getting a porter because there was a large group leaving. That’s fine except that no one told us that we would have to wait. Kids were in the pool at 6 AM screaming - not desirable if you have a poolside room like I did.","Positive","LARK70",5,"Traveled with family","October 2018"

"Having such great reviews online does create high expectations.  In short, Tentrem is probably the best hotel in Yogya in the eyes of locals. The hotel is beautifully designed with cleverly placed design elements, like on the balcony ceiling when it lights up at night. Staff were attentive and helpful.  The breakfast spread is a wonderful mix of local and western cuisines. The espresso shot I ordered ranks among the best I have ever had. Also check out the indonesian kopi nusantara coffee stand with an attendant who brews your cuppa on the spot; and the cart lady with juices and herbal concoctions.

The staff compliments the Tentrem's design in warm  welcoming smiles and greetings and and with their professional six star service.  My advice is to either have a car and driver waiting for you the airport or arrange the car service with the hotel, it's quite a bargain through the hotel and it's always nice to have great hotel service begin as soon as you leave the airport.

The authority of the Hotel presented her a lovely Birthday cake and a nice family photograph taken on that particular occasion. Hope my daughter will remember this incident throughout her life.

Aside the super friendly staff, great staff services and super comfortable (with reasonable price as well!!!) place, Hotel Tentrem served with heart. You know they do, cause you can feel it.

"Hotel Tentrem is a luxury hotel in the middle of Yogjakarta. The rooms are large and offer everything you would expect from a luxury hotel. The price of the rooms represents good value for money.   By contrast, the restaurant and bars are fairly poor value for money and we would not recommend these. The food was fine, but not exceptional and the cost was similar to what we would expect to pay in London. The staff are lovely and very eager to help. Perhaps they can be a bit too eager to help as on occasion it became a bit uncomfortable when they would watch you eat/run to assist you at the salad bar when you were just browsing. The breakfast boxes they provide for when you cannot make it to breakfast (e.g. when you have an early morning flight or a visit to see the sunrise at…","Positive","dnra4ever",3,"Traveled with family","October 2017"

"This large and luxurious hotel is about 40-60 mins from the airport, depending on traffic. The first impression on entering the hotel is a sense of calm and space, reinforced by the gentle scents of lemongrass that greet the tired traveller. Checkin was efficient and uncomplicated. Sophisticated elevators whisk you upwards, and once in, the rooms give you a sense of spacious elegance. Bathrooms open on to the bedroom in a glass-fronted wall, allowing light to stream through (though there is a shade that can be lowered). Bed was kingsized and very comfortable, and all mod-cons were provided. The only slight drawback was the absence of plain coffee - the only option that was provided was a ginger-flavoured coffee. The lower ground floor of the hotel houses the very substantial…","Positive","mostlyharmless",5,"Traveled on business","October 2017"
"Stayed three nights with the main aim of visiting the famous UNESCO World Heritage temples at Prambanan and Borobudur.  We chose to stay in Yogyakarta rather than nearer Borobudur.   The hotel is around an hour away from the airport. Not exactly far but traffic can be heavy in the narrow streets of the city.   The hotel itself is rather new. It has a large lobby area where two tuk-tuks (not sure what’s it called in Indonesia) are parked. These were signed by the President and Vice-President of Indonesia. Staff were uniformly friendly and helpful.   We decided on the Executive Room, which are located on the 8th floor where the Executive Lounge is also located. Ibu Tika will take good care of you.

A friend of mine was having an argument about this with the ""bouncer"" and had to go back to the room to change the slippers on the first day. They should have asked the person nicely instead of dismissing without giving any solutions. I think they should do something about this.

So I was pretty much satisfied with the room. The hotel staff are very helpful too. One night it was almost midnight, and I need a mouthwash for my toothache. Even though they don't provide mouthwash, when I asked the hotel, they delivered it to my room.  If you are a gym enthusiast like me, you should try their gym.

"We came for a short getaway to visit Borobudur and other temples. The Tentrem hotel was the most expensive one and I've assumed that it's the best one in Yogyakarta, so we booked it for 2 nights.  First disappointment that the hotel was trying to charge us additional 1 600 000 IDR (~ 120 USD) for a baby bed for a 4 years old child. Which is not only too much for Yogyakarta, but most of 5* stars provide this service complementary by request. Check in is super slow, the staff is not very friendly or welcoming. They put the complimentary drinks dispensing machine near the reception, but it looks very old + a lot of dirty glasses most of the time.

They have many options, so you need more than 1 week to try it all.

The room was just a little above average,  comfy bed, big flat screen TV, WiFi Internet but the speed is only at 2Mbps (quite slow).  Bathroom is clean,  shower room equipped with standard amenities. Free drinks on mini bar yet nothing is stand out about the room.   I also use the ballroom for annual company ceremony. Big and spacious ball room in separate building conjunction to the hotel. Need a little exercise to go…","Positive","Wahyu Hagono",4,"Traveled with family","December 2016"
"Unique fragrance directly welcoming your nose from the main lobby, and friendly staff offer 'jamu' for welcome drink upon check in, nice to try. Well recognition by surprisingly provide us a cake in the room as We were on honeymoon, even there were some ants around the cake, appreciate it. amazing and luxury room with nice bath tub almost perfect but we can still heard the noisy from the street on the first night,too bad. Finally we could sleep well for the rest of the nights after we move to room facing the pool on the next day.  We don't have to worry how to go to Malioboro street since they provide free drop off service every hour, and We go back to hotel by traditional transport 'Becak'. Wish they have pick up service as well to go back to hotel.  Superb breakfast,…","Positive","Adi7790",5,"Traveled on business","December 2016"

"Located not too far from Tugu Yogyakarta, makes it easy and quiet near to go to the main attractions there. Unfortunately we went there during the long weekend so the traffic was quiet bad to and from the hotel.  First stay we had good view to the pool, 2nd stay was not that lucky and we got the view to ""mountain"" (actually to the local houses view with mountain way on the back"".  The room is quiet spacious, modern look with some local decoration. The drinks in the fridge is free, not too bad! The beds are so comfy, the facility representing 5stars hotel, large breakfast area and... Amazing taste of the local foods in the Indonesia corner... Yummy... Top for the chefs!

"The Tentrem is a delightful surprise.  Why?  It is a true luxury hotel in a small city, at which I would not have expected such high standards (with all respect due small cities!).  The sheer quality of this property, from its construction, materials, furnishings and everything in between, speaks of a no-expense spared approach, yet its prices are very reasonable - I paid around US$100 per night including tax, service charge and breakfast.  Even the staff are impeccably attired in various batik designs (depending on the department), and were all attractive.  The hotel is situated approximately 20 minutes' drive from the airport (double that in heavy traffic) and 10 minutes' drive from the Jalan Malioboro tourist strip - I am glad that I did not stay near there, because that…","Positive","Seat 2A",5,"Traveled with family","September 2016"

Especially in their KayuManis resto during breakfast. It was crowded and acceptable if their staffs were tired. But their manager or captain (forgot to ask the name) was there to keep them maintain the quality even over a small thing. Salute.  And please keep it up.

High ceilings, tasteful furnishings, marble and granite, proper shower drainage, quality fixtures, cotton bedding, nice robes and plush towels.   Thin walls though as we could clearly hear glass bathroom doors closing nextdoor.  Standards were not as high because of the choice of bathroom amenities, breakfast buffet choice (ok for local fare but poor quality for the western choices) and attention to detail.

"Having paid a lot of money to stay in this hotel, really made us give high expectation on this hotel. But at the end we felt lucky that we stayed there only for one night. First impression was very bad. We arrived at the hotel at 2.30 (30 minutes early) and had to wait 1,5 hours to check in while my 3-year-old daughter was sleepy and cranky. We spent about 20 minutes in the hotel's playground and when we went back to the receptionist, our room was still not ready. Had to wait again in the lobby and watch another guest (that arrived at the same time with us) yelling at the receiptionist complaining about their service.

"Hotel Tentrem is a relatively new upmarket hotel in central Yogyakarta.  It is about a 20 minute ride to the airport and less than that to get to the Kraton.  The location on Jl Sangaji is relatively unpreposessing as it is not a particularly notable street.    Tentrem is owned by a herbal medicine magnate but is a sophisticated and artistically designed property with the air of luxury.  It also includes a large conference centre as an attached building.  There is an outdoor swimming pool.  The central lobby area of Tentrem is large and comfortable.  It has an enormously high ceiling as the middle of the second floor is open meaning there is a sense of this being a massive space.  There are a dozen or so chairs available.

But we can say that as this property is rather new too - hopefully can stay the same after ages (if the maintenance is good enough). The manning, ufffftt, can't say much about this - just one word - they need serious and tight training in hospitality (excpet the bellman & security). The reception guy can't even decide or think fast when I really need to change USD100 with 5 of USD20 or maybe 2 of USD50. The sales team was so unbearably very weird on the making rules/system.

The drain in the shower stink when I took a shower. And the worst, our room light flickered when we turned off the light to sleep. Have to call reception and they sent an engineer. Breakfast was so so. Seems like the hotel tries to save some electricity bills by turning down/off air conditioning as some areas are just too warm. Service staff need to be trained more in being more attentive, friendlier. ","Negative","ongol-ongol",2,"Traveled with family","January 2016"

Because there are a lot of great hotel in yogyakarta. The day i arrived at jogja we picked up by hotel's driver. And i shocked when i saw tentrem not as small as i think in fact. Just could saying ""awesome"". Then we took our breakfast at the restaurant ""kayumanis"". Again, this is awesome. The staff were very kind, friendly, helpfull.

The property was quite nice, clean, modern and strategically located not far from city center. The room (we checked in the Premiere Room) was spacious with standard amenities, although, surprisingly it didn't have bathtub (only shower).  Unfortunately the services were not up to my expectation for a five stars hotel.   1. We arrived at the hotel at late afternoon (around 3.30 pm), yet we had to wait for almost another 1 hour before we could get our room ready ( and I had to keep asking if our room was ready)  2.

The security checks before entering the hotel were troublesome although it may seem necessary to certain people. When I entered the hotel, it looked big and majestic and hence, I was expecting a rather good stay. At a glance, the premium room was clean and nice except for the fact that we could only borrow ironing boards for max 2 hours. There were also complimentary drinks.

Definitely recommend this hotel, for those who expecting a traditional touch of javanese culture with world class luxury experience.","Positive","SunPer",5,"Traveled on business","August 2015"

"If you're looking for modern, vast hotel within Yogya city, Tentrem hotel is the best choice. The location is near from almost all of the most key places in Yogya but it is not in the middle of traffic and tourist hustle. The services, the rooms, the interiors and the foods are excellent. The price is very reasonable, worth the value very much. It is suitable for both family or business. Additional plus for business ocassion : the hotel has huge ballrooms for big events.","Positive","Andi",5,"Traveled with family","September 2015"

"Plenty of options in Yogyakarta, but if you want a very decent, stylish and bigger sized hotel, Tentrem is highly recommended. Rooms are spacious, clean and trendy. Facilities are modern and well-kept. Beautiful huge swimming pool, although you can only enjoy the sunshine for a few hours due to the top floor blocking the afternoon sun from 3pm (maybe the building contractors should have looked at the orbit of the sun before actually constructing the hotel and pool...). Restaurants are good, but not great. However, breakfast was one of the best and with the most choice we had one our 3-week holiday in Indonesia! One minor thing you just can't escape from is the loud speaker noise from the local mosque at 4.30am...it would matter less if they sing/pray nicely, but when it's so…","Positive","Chris B",5,"Traveled with family","August 2015"
"I stayed 4 nights at this pleasant hotel recently when I attended an international conference at the hotel. Its name never fails to make me smile, as ""tentrem"" (peacefulness in Bahasa Indonesia) sounds so much like ""tantrum"", a direct opposite :)  From the moment I stepped foot into the hotel, I was transfixed by its impressive and tastefully decorated interior. The staff, from the concierge to the receptionist, was courteous and efficient in their work. Check in was a breeze and I was glad that my room was available long before the official check in time.

"Stayed there in May 2013, but left me with an unforgettable impression. At first i had doubt to book this hotel as it was considered brand new without any connectedness with well-known hotel provider, not to mention a very limited online information on it. Having compared it to Sheraton and Hyatt, i finally book the hotel due to value for money.  I stayed in a premier room, which have a balcony and pool view. The room was clean, spacious, well decorated and excellent amenities. The lobby was elegant, breakfast was terrific with a touch of local served ""Gudeg"", nice pool. Supported by great staff. Enjoyed every detail in the hotel.  I also had a satisfactory dinner in the duck king, very recommended.

The hotel lobby was classy and grand. Check-in was done earlier by the conference organiser, so I just had to pick the room key from the reception staff. The room was big, spacious, classy and well maintained. The gym has extensive cardio and resistance equipment. The infinity pool is great, although a view of the local houses gave me a sense of the income disparity in Indonesia, between the haves and have-nots, if you know what I mean.

Check in was quick and two types of local drinks were offered as a token of welcome. We liked the taste of the drink with tangy flavor.  The deluxe room was very spacious with a large comfortable bed, a sofa, foot rest and writing desk. Upon closer inspection we noticed stain marks on the sofa and the foot rest...not expected from a new hotel. The interconnecting walls appeared to be thin as we could heard sounds coming from the adjacent room.

I was asking room with bathtube this time because the last time I went, they provide me room with only shower bathroom, which is very uncomfortable. Unfortunately they said they cannot provide room with bathtube because they have only limited rooms with bathtube and its already occupied and leave me with no option. The occupied part is of chourse not for them to blame but the limited room with bathtube is a big no for a 5 star hotel. Hopefully they will improve their bathrooms in the future.

I was upgraded to a Suite and it was HUGE! And the Suite level has its own dining room so I had breakfast all by myself! It really felt like home.

This time my Javanese friend suggested we stay at the Tentrem as he was concerned the Sheraton is haunted;) I was very impressed, the hotel facilities are beautiful, the pool is stunning and there are nice Javanese touches throughout the hotel.  The staff are very polite and helpful, though the check in process was a little slow, but hey whats the rush, this is Indonesia!  The rooms are nice with very comfortable beds with numerous different pillow styles.  Free mini bar(non-alcoholic) is a nice touch as is the ordering room service through the TV, though the efficiency of this is somewhat negated by the fact that room service call you straight away after you have ordered to confirm your order.

"I stayed at this hotel for two nights with my family. I drove my car myself and there was a valet service. Check in was quick. The room is spacious with one sofa bed so we didn't need an extra bed. There is swimming pool for adult and children. And there is kids playground. Breakfast was standard with complete menu international and local cuisine. We also ordered room service and took lunck at the restaurant before check out. The food are good enough. All over service is OK. The hotel located not too far from Malioboro. There is free shuttle car to Malioboro but we have to back to hotel by ourself. We back hotel using delman which gave us different experience. To Kaliurang from hotel also easy.

I had the pleasure of staying at the Tentrem from 10th to 14th of June and I must congratulate you on the efficiency and attentiveness of your staff - the quality & comfort of the room and the courtesy that was shown to us.

They responded quickly when I inquired about it, and the process of collecting it was very easy.   Room service is pretty good; selection is limited but the ones we ordered were all very tasty and are reasonably priced.

Premier Room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Great shower. Massive comfy bed. I had a bit of trouble with the A/C but managed ok. I get the impression that the suite rooms are considerably larger but I was unable to book one on-line.  SMART TV system is impressive as is the online in room dining system. Sometimes though I do just like to talk to someone - which I did and they were very helpful once they'd begun to understand my English.   Gym was first class, apart from the constant VERY LOUD music.

"A friend of mine recommended this hotel, as it has positive reviews and apparently  it is one of the newest hotel in Jogja. In my opinion, the prices were reasonable, especially for this luxury oriented type of hotel. The first impression that I got from this hotel was good, until I lay down on the bed. I don't know if it is only in my room or not, the sheet was shockingly smell like sweat, fortunately on the next day they changed the sheet. Moreover, the staff in the restaurant wasn't as friendly as those in the lobby, they (staff in the restaurant) didn't even let me know if they about to start to finish the breakfast time, I realized it when I wanted to take the food from the tray , and one of the staff already emptied it.

"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in early June.  'tentrem' is derived from the Javanese word roughly means peace. The hotel is very thick with Javanese culture. Dominated by brown and light brown color, with a Javanese decor. You'll see a lot of batik ornaments at this hotel.  The bedroom is very large, marble floored. The beds are very good quality with lots of choice of pillows. There is a long sofa on the side of the window, also with some pillows. Linen is very clean and soft. The bathroom has a modern design. There is a choice between a regular shower or a rain-fall models.  Breakfast is quite varied with more local food. The food is very tasty.

And they're the first hotel in Jogja equipped with smart TV (more TV channels with video on demand would be great, though). Not the most expensive hotel, but surely the most luxurious. Downsides : breakfast are so-so... Plenty of choice, though. No free-WiFi in rooms & public space (well it's a trademark of a 5-star hotel, isn't it?)

I highly recommend this place to stay for families or couples who are on vacation in Jogjakarta. In addition you get a place to stay, you also get a place for relaxation.

Hotel Tentrem turned out to be a lot larger than we expected – for some people this might be a plus point, for us it was a detracting factor, because the service feels a lot less personal. Pros: i) respectable-sized pool that you can swim in, ii) standard of food was decent (I thoroughly enjoyed the Sambal Prawns and Nasi Campur that I ordered for lunch, and my other half liked his Western sets too), iii) great service at the concierge – the staff there are always all smiles and very helpful in helping us get Taxis etc, iv) free “shuttle service” going to Malioboro which turned out to be private cars!

You won't need an extra bed if you stay with a group of 3 or 4, its comfortable to sleep in it. They also provide 7 bed pillow and 3 sofa pillow.   I rarely use hotel's amenities, but i cant resist to use the soap, simply because its smells like lemongrass. Its so good.  The price is also valueable.

It's on the north side of Yogya so probably not the best if your attentions are focused on the south but that goes without saying. The rooms were beautiful, service was immaculate and restaurant was very good. I found the bar a little pricey by Indonesian standards, but this is an international hotel.

The check in process was smooth and I noted that the price is quite cheap for this kind of hotel, probably it is because they're just opened for business.

For instance, on 2 occaisions there were food, drinks or condiments lacking with room service. When we called the front desk to report, they took 20mins to bring the missing items and by then the original order was obviously cold. The drinks (cocktails) were sometimes rather good and sometimes terrible.

Hotel Tentrem wasn't yet available when we originally booked, but fortunately their timing turned out to be perfect.

In any other city we would rate this is a ""very good"" hotel, but for local standards it really is excellent.

"Tentrem is a lovely new luxury hotel in downtown Yogjakarta.  The location is not very convenient and there is nowhere to go within walking distance.  The shopping areas and main attractions are 20 mins by taxi through the chaotic traffic.  There is no nightlife nearby and the hotel bar is extremely quiet.  The rooms are large, lovely, clean and comfortable and we had a spectacular view of Mount Merapi, which dominates the city skyline.  The staff are extremely helpful, particularly the concierges.  I felt the restaurant could cater a little more to the Western palate, as we struggled to identify most things in the breakfast buffet. Our stay at Tentrem was very pleasant, but I think the downtown location is too far from the centre of Yoga.","Positive","linshimm",4,"Traveled with family","April 2013"

State of the art building, luxurious interior and art work, beautiful swimming pool ( the pool bar is so cozy, made me love it on the first sight!). The facilities are superb, fantastic gym (definitely the best I've experienced so far), and impressive kids playground.  The room is spacious and very comfy, with extremely comfortable bed and pillows. I had to put extra effort to wake up every morning. The breakfast at Kayu Manis is great and delicious with enormous choices of food, and Duck King is add to perfection.  On the top of that, friendly and helpful staffs are always be the most important thing. You are always greeted with smile and warmth on every corner of the hotel. You can't find it in other hotel with such…","Positive","Niken W",5,"Traveled with family","December 2012"
"Everything exceed the expectations in this hotel. How you would like describing a great hotel? great service? luxurious traditional architecture? a bliss and soulful place? This hotel has them all. The room is very spacious and the choice of the f&b has a lot of varieties from international cuisine to local one and of course mentioning 'jamu' (Javanese traditional beverage) is a must here. Definitely will come back.","Positive","Ivan S",5,"Traveled with family","March 2013"
"I had a very pleasant stay during my 2 days business trip in Jogjakarta. For a start, I think the price that they offer is amazing. You'll get a 5 star+ hotel, with 5 star+ facilites and services, with a 3 star price. Love all of the small details - your name on a huge lcd screen, a glass of cold jamu as the welcome drink, salak as condiments. The staffs are all very friendly and helpful. The gym is fantastic, the pool area is beautiful. The bed is something to talk about, I can really have a nice rest after my long meetings. It's also a great idea to have the kids playground, something that not all hotel in Indonesia thought about. I'd imagine I'd take my kids here sometime coz I know they would enjoy their stay here.","Positive","lucynda g",5,"Traveled with family","February 2013"
"We got the first impression of TOP 5 STARS hotel with a combination of modern yet a classy traditional Indonesian culture. My family have experienced late check-in process around 11pm and the staffs are very helpful and friendly. We were given a room immediately.The room is spacious and comfortable. Not to forget the nice view of the swimming pool. The hotels also offer great facilities. the fitness area smells nice and provides almost every machine you will need. The kids love the kids area. Duck king restaurant is a must try! and mini market in front of the hotel adds another +","Positive","JeckoNL",5,"Traveled on business","February 2013"
"first time i walked in to this hotel ... WOW....seriously? this kind of hotel exists in Jogjakarta?  Definitely more than a 5-star hotel... maybe 6 or 7... I stayed there for 3 nights with my family (i wish i've stayed longer). i will definitely come back in the next future.... The staff is the best, very friendly and in a good manner, the pool is great, breakfast is awesome and not forgetting the duck king and the HEAVENLY kids playground...my kids loveeddd it !!!! The room is very spacious, we got the twin bed for me, my husbands and my 2 kids... probably one of the best hotel room in Indonesia !!  Recommended !","Positive","esther y",5,"Traveled with family","February 2013"
"We arrived at 2 pm but the room was not ready.We decided not to make a fuss since they said it would be ready in 30 minutes then we went to the kids club to wait. After 1 hour, we came back up and again the room was not ready and no other room was available. However, the most dissapointing thing is that the receptionist and receptionist manager both tried to downgrade our room to deluxe while we have paid premier room with balcony  This is really not a five star service and the first time in my experience that a hotel trying to downgrade because of their own inefficiency in getting the room ready  Finally the room was ready at 3.30 pm then they broke another dissapointing news that the pool was under maintenance. They later called us around 4 pm that the ph balance of the pool…","Negative","Edimel",2,"Traveled with family","March 2013"
"If not the best hotel in Jogya, it would have certainly be in the top 3, particularly for value, as this hotel would command twice the price if it were in say Jakarta. The hotel is (literally) brand new and although it seems like no expense was sparred, it still tries and retains in Javanese charm.  Best points:  Facilities/presentation: Well, you would almost certainly expect this to be it's strong point, given its marketing itself as a 5 star hotel, offering high level of luxury (by its own admission) and its brand new (hasnt even had its official grand opening according to the staff.   Rooms are very spacious, massive LCD TV and equally spacious bathroom/toilet (has a rain shower as well).   Hotel also has indoor playground for children (open until 10pm at night) and is…","Positive","lovetotravel79_11",5,"Traveled with family","February 2013"
"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel and I absolutely loved it! The property is new and everything is immaculate, I personally loved the pool and the bar by the pool, prices are very affordable and service is great, a bit slow, but everyone at the hotel takes pride on their job! The hotel provides with a shuttle to go to Malioboro street every hour, that comes very handy! Breakfast buffet was very nice and they also provide you with a breakfast box if you need to leave before 6 AM. We had a massage at the SPA and that was great, also the gym, the jacuzzi and the sauna are amazing. My only minor complain will be the AC in the room, it is very noisy and not very strong. Hope you guys enjoy this hotel, and please, do go to Borobudur in the early morning for the sunrise, it is absolutely…","Positive","Pablost",5,"Traveled with family","February 2013"
"even the hotel just did the soft opening and there was still a lot of work going on, it was a perfect stay and it is a very luxury and trendy place to spend some days during business acitvities in Jogja - now you can get a opening promotion price which is really unbelievable for this kind of hotel, the breakfast is one of the best I ever had, very special and a lot of choices....the pool area is very well done, with nice coffee shop and bar on the poolside...the rooms are superb, some of them with balcony, for smokers and a cozy lounge outside....the gym is great and it lures you to do some training there....all in one, a perfect hotel, will be even more perfect after all the last things are done and it will run normally....I love it","Positive","chrisconsul",5,"Traveled on business","January 2013"
"I didn't expect to find a luxurious and tasteful hotel in Yogyakarta and enjoyed the stay very much. The room is modern, clean and classy. Breakfast selection was equally great - there are some local food as well. The spa is a great destination after your shopping trip to relax your tired muscle. Well done! (by the way, the only drawback was the air condition and wifi which sometimes didn't work - which understandable because this hotel was newly opened).","Positive","Totofore",5,"Traveled with family","February 2013"
"I haven't stayed at the Tentrem yet, so this review is for the restaurant there only. The hotel is brand new, and huge - or at least huge in appearance. The entrance can accommodate elephants and the atrium feels a lot like that scene from Lord of the Rings.  The elevators are hidden away to the side (not sure why). I had to ask them where the restaurant was, and then had to ask again where the elevators were. Then, as I exited the elevator on the LG floor (that's where the restaurant is), I was confused again: where do I go? Where is the restaurant? I started aimlessly walking and was about to ask a lady behind a desk in the hallway, and then I saw it right behind her: the Kayu Manis Restaurant.  The name ""Kayu Manis"" is Indonesian for ""cinnamon""; perhaps it is a jab at Hyatt's…","Positive","Waqqas H",4,"Traveled with family","February 2013"
